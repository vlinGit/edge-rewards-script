# edge-rewards-script

This is a personal project to make an automatic Microsoft rewards script.

For personal use:
- Install the edge drivers that matches your current browser version and replace the one located inside `/edgeSearch`
- Make sure you're already signed into edge beforehand
- CD into `/edgeSearch` and run `edgeSearch.py`
- Make sure the browser is focused and DO NOT unfocus it until the script is done
